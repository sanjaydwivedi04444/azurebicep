# Azure Bicep
Bicep enables you to deploy Azure resources. Bicep uses a declarative syntax that you treat like application code. Treating your infrastructure as code enables you to track changes to your infrastructure requirements and makes your deployments more consistent and repeatable.

If you're familiar with the JSON syntax for writing Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), you'll find that Bicep provides a more concise syntax and improved type safety. In fact, Bicep files compile to standard ARM templates.
